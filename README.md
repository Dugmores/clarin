#new stuff
this project is testing Github codespaces.
It was entirely created, modified run, deployed in codespaces.
the beautiy of the whole project virtual spaces and understanding of docker containers.
But in future I'm hoping to add more of docker, kubernetes and all the ochestration with advance automation capabilities
