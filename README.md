--new stuff (no desktop or laptop) just pure android phone


this project is testing Github codespaces on mobile phone
It was entirely created, modified run, deployed in codespaces.
the beauty of the whole project is virtual spaces and understanding of docker containers.
But in future I'm hoping to add more of docker, kubernetes and all the ochestration with advance automation capabilities
